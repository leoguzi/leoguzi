### Hi there, I'm Leo ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm LÃ©o, a Full-stack web developer with 3 years of experience. I work with TypeScript and Angular on the front-end and ASP.NET on the back-end, and have experience with Node.js, React.js, and automated testing using Cypress. I'm also used to work with agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently studying Information Technology at the Federal University of Santa Catarina.

ðŸš€ I'm always open to learning new technologies and tackling complex challenges.

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy writing clean, well-structured code, following Clean Code practices, and ensuring quality with automated testing, always focusing on efficiency and performance.
